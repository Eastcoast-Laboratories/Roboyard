# Roboyard Accessibility & Solver Target Bugfix Plan

## Notes
- Multi-color targets were incorrectly mapped to red due to missing handling in GameState.getGridElements(); this is now fixed.
- Logging for target conversion in GameStateManager and SolverDD was marked as possibly unreachable, confirming alternate code paths.
- User reported accessibility mode issues: missing coordinates in target announcements, unwanted solution computation message, and hint announcements should only include the last step, not history.
- Confirmed `target_a11y` string exists and is used for target announcements; bug may be in usage (possible double-appending or formatting error).
- Located code for "KI berechnet Lösung ..." announcement and hint accessibility announcement logic in ModernGameFragment.java for targeted fixes.

## Task List
- [x] Diagnose and fix multi-color target mapping bug
- [x] Add/mark logging for unreachable code paths
- [x] Fix accessibility announcement: include coordinates in target announcement
- [ ] Remove announcement: "KI berechnet Lösung ..."
- [ ] Announce only the last step in hints, not the history

## Current Goal
Fix accessibility announcements per user feedback
