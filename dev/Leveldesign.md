# Level design

Level 1: 
- simple solution in  moves
- board size: 10x10

Level 2:
- teaches, that robots block other robots
- solution in 3 moves
- board size: 10x12

Level 3:
- teaches, that robots are on the path to the target, and that you have to move it away first
- solution in 3 moves
- board size: 12x12

Level 4:
- teaches, that robots are on the path to the target, and that you have to move it away first and that you have more ways to solve it
- solution in 3 moves
- board size: 12x12
  
Level 5:
- teaches, that you need other robots to prepare the path
- solution in 3 moves
- board size: 12x12

Level 6:
- from now on all board size: 12x14

TODO:
- Check all levels for different solutions so that solving it with only 1 or 2 stars is possible too in a way htat is different from the 3 star solution
